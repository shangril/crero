	Here you will find licensing information for each .js Javascript file that the CreRo instance you came from, and that is free software, loads.
	<br/>This is the default setting of CreRo, and your exact server, which chose to use CreRo, may have added extra other .js dependecies from which this page cannot be aware. 
	<br/>To protect your privacy, to detect non-free and potentially dangerous embeded Javascript code on webpages you visit, you make want to take a look at the GNU Librejs project:
	<br/>It's a browser extension that can be used to detect free Javascript, block non-free Javascript, and much more. CreRo, and the site you came from which uses CreRo, have complete support to
	<br/>talk with Librejs about the freedom in their Javascript dependencies used !
	<br/>Go to: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/">gnu.org/software/librejs</a>. Note that, currently, this is an extension for Mozilla-based web browsers, such as Firefox, Icecat, Tor-Browser... It will not work on Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Chromium, etc), Safari, or Opera (AFAIK).  
<hr/>
Format of each line is: (possibly minified) Javascript file link ; Free license of this Javascript File ; unminified, human-readable source code link for the Javascript file.
