This is cretID3

cretID3 is a basic fork from getID3. Please see the getID3.* prefixed files in this directory for more information about getID3 ; copyright, licensing, changelog are the most important parts. 

cretID3 is 

* a Freeze from GetID3 master branch, last updated Sep, 14 2022 7am UTC+2 ; this is then a freeze from a version in beta stage. 
* a Subset from GetID3 ; it ONLY includes what is necessary to deal with read-only access to metadata ("tags") since write access was only needed, when creating this fork, by a niche usage for the target software (see point 4 below) that we chose to deprecate then. 
* cretID3 is LGPL v3 licenced - refer to LICENCE for full legal text of the license. Refer to getID3.license.txt for how and why cretID3 can be LGPL licensed
* cretID3 is not a standalone project, but specifically a side project for and from CreRo, the CMS for records labels (AGPL licensed), an distributed as-is with CreRo in the Redist-LGPL/ directory of the CreRo distribution
* anything related to cretID3 should be regarded directly with the CreRo core team. CreRo can be reached via several ways: #crero IRC channel on https://libera.chat (primarily), http://crero.clewn.org (includes up-to-date contact email), and https://github.com/shangril/crero which is the code repo and provides the various things offered by GitHub ranging from plain download to bug reports. 

If you wish to support GetID3 and James Heinrich's own work, which was the prerequisite for cretID3 creation, including by a monetary donation, please got to https://getid3.org

cretID3 was created upon his work, alongside with the work of people mentionned in getID3.changelog.txt included here, and cretID3 was created by Nicolas "Shangri-l" Chartoire for the purpose of having a CreRo no longer requiring a manual download of GetID3 by its users.
