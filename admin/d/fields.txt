In such case, this option is mandatory to have a working, HTTPS link to your site in the YP server's listing and for the YP to communicate with your site for requesting additionnal infos as genres, artist list, and so on. If somedays you no longer need this ForceHTTPS (as an exemple if you no longer have HTTPS available and went back to plain HTTP) reset this option to 0 to make YP listing work properly again. 
YP-APIMisconfiguredDateOnHostingToleranceWindow.txt
VERY special case. If your media tier host has not an on-time timestamp to reply to freshness calls, which are used by crero-yp-api.php for caching media tiers data, this options allows you to set a window for which the cached data will be served anyway, no matter if the server replied with a non-on time timestamp. Note that is value is bi-directionnal, and will be honored in the case of the server having an internal clock set in the future as well as in the past. It is expressed in seconds and decimal values are allowed. Default value is of 0 seconds which disable completely this setting.

It is mainly useful for quota-based low-end hosting plans which can have trouble to make the http access. Most install will not need this option, especially if the RadioFeatured tracks are already correctly playlisted by the radio.
